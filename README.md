# dentist-diary-desktop
Program for managing history of dentist's patients visits
## Usage

The application is launched by double-clicking on .jar file. After that, you need to register and log in to the program. After opening the main window in the folder, the program will automatically create a folder "DB", where the file with the patient database will be stored.

Never delete the "DB" folder or the files in it. This will delete all the data stored in the database!
